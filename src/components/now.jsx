            Iâ€™m currently a Frontend Engineer intern at Partechnologies and
            Consult. I started on December 27, 2024, after my vacation. In my
            first week, I worked on crafting an employee management dashboard
            designed to help Human Resource Managers efficiently manage
            employee-related tasks. If you havenâ€™t seen my employee management
            dashboard yet, check it out:{" "}
            <Link
              to="/projects/employee-management"
              className="text-blue-400 font-bold gap-2"
            >
              Look here ðŸ‘€
            </Link>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The first implementation of this dashboard is available
            <Link
              to="/projects/teamvault"
              className="text-blue-400 font-bold  gap-2 ml-1"
            >
              here ðŸ‘€
            </Link>
            . I had to make several changes along the way as I continued
            improving the User Experience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Throughout this internship, I leveraged multiple skills, including
            React.js, React Hooks, JavaScript, Vite, CSS, and Figma, to develop
            and refine the dashboard. Working in an Agile environment, I applied
            Scrum methodologies, participated in daily stand-ups, and
            contributed to discussions about Software Development Life Cycle
            (SDLC) and Software Documentation. This experience also strengthened
            my User Interface Design (UI), User Experience Design (UX), and
            Front-End Development skills.

            In February, through Partechnologies and Consult, I had the
            opportunity to work on a real-world projectâ€”developing a website for
            an organization focused on global deal sourcing. This project was
            both fun and challenging, giving me what felt like a yearâ€™s worth of
            experience in just a month.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Daily Scrum meetings and applying Agile methodologies in a
            real-world setting were incredibly insightful. One particular
            three-hour meeting was so educational that it completely changed my
            approach to writing and structuring code. I also got the chance to
            learn Zustand for global state management and useSWR for data
            fetching.
